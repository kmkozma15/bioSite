                        <p>I was born and raised in Playas de Tijuana, Mexico. Playas de Tijuana is located near Mexicali and the border of San Diego.
                            While growing up, I lived with my mother, father, and fraternal twin sister, Pamela. 
                            We grew up in a home overlooking the beach. Though we did not visit the beach 
                            too often, my favorite memory as a child, is getting together with my 
                            cousins every Saturday and playing games with them.</p>

                            I love building new things. There is always something new I 
                            learn from old projects
                             I have worked on. My favorite way to pass time is by 
                             creating new things that solve old problems.</p>

                                    During my college years, photography has opened new doors for me. 
                                    I have met amazing people, experienced new places and honed my skill as a photographer. 
                                    I have won multiple photography contests and 
                                    I enjoy going to cinema expos and testing out the latest equipment.

                                    Throughout my childhood, my father has taught me everything I know today about auto mechanics. 
                                    He has repaired many cars and I have helped him throughout the process. 
                                    He has taught me how to weld radiators, fix a flat tire, and repair engines.

                            I oversee all incoming and outgoing technology within the warehouse. I repair computers and troubleshoot equipment issues associates may be experiencing. 
                            I am thankful for my position and the opportunity to learn alongside a global company. Going forward, my goal is to continue
                             growing alongside the Amazon Information Technology department and take part in their Associate-to-Tech program. I plan on
                            becoming an IT Technician so I may further support my associates and continue doing what I love.
                            Without the love and support from my partner, friends and family, I do not know where I would be."
